TabWidget

Next:
	- Ability to drop to edges of the screen. 
		* might be tough to do the visualisation, because now it's done in tabWidget, and you can't draw outside of the containing widget. This means that if we want to get the visualisation, we have to move drawing somewhere else. Maybe in the splitter? It would make sense for it to be there..
		.. Splitter is a QFrame so this should work, but there might be problems with it being drawn behind..
	- Save layout.
	
Low Priority:
	- Floating window.
	- Improve visualisation. Make it even more clear where the dragged widget will end up.
