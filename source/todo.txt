TabWidget

Next:
	- Ability to drop to edges of the screen. 
		* might be tough to do the visualisation, because now it's done in tabWidget, and you can't draw outside of the containing widget. This means that if we want to get the visualisation, we have to move drawing somewhere else. Maybe in the splitter? It would make sense for it to be there..
		.. Splitter is a QFrame so this should work, but there might be problems with it being drawn behind..
	- Save layout.
	
Low Priority:
	- Floating window.
	- Improve visualisation. Make it even more clear where the dragged widget will end up.




Restore tab size in Spine
=============================
	- When Orientation is different - use preferred size, (it could be better to split in half, because this does not always work well)
		else, use current index size. (seems like this does not work well for vertical size)
	- When index is removed from widget, and moved to another (last tab). The index size is also removed. Looks like the viewport has priority when it comes to where the available space is inserted to.
